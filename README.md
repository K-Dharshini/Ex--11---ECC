# Ex--11---ECC

## AIM:
To implement the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) key exchange algorithm and securely derive a shared secret key.

## DESIGN STEPS:

### Step 1:
Design the ECC key exchange algorithm.

### Step 2:
Implement the ECC key exchange algorithm using C.

### Step 3:
In ECC-based Diffie-Hellman, a base point G on the elliptic curve is chosen, and both Alice and Bob select private keys. Their public keys are calculated as multiples of the base point. The shared secret is generated by combining each party's private key with the other party's public key.
